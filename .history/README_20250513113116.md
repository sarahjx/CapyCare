- Stopwatch to track playtime
- Pause/Resume functionality

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A local web server (due to browser security restrictions)

## Running the Project Locally

### Option 1: Using Python's built-in server (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer

   - Python 3.x: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Python 2.x: Usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux

2. Open your terminal/command prompt

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/petgame
   ```

4. Start a local server:

   - For Python 3:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - For Python 2:
     ```bash
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
     ```

5. Open your web browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/html/landing.html
   ```

### Option 2: Using VS Code Live Server

1. Install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

2. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code

   - Click the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Live Server"
   - Click "Install" on the extension by Ritwick Dey

3. Open the project folder in VS Code

4. Right-click on `html/landing.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

### Option 3: Using Node.js http-server

1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/

2. Install http-server globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/petgame
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/html/landing.html
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If images don't load, make sure you're running the project through a web server and not directly opening the HTML files
- If you see CORS errors in the console, ensure you're using one of the server methods described above
- Clear your browser cache if you see outdated content
